## Abstract
### We analyzed a global pharmaceutical manufacturing company's raw sales data and gained meaningful insights. By using the PowerBI tool, we built a data model where dimensions and facts are separated by the provided data is in a single table format, and then they are linked together by logical relationships to form a star schema. So we extracted useful information by analyzing pharmaceutical sales, distributor and customer information, and sales team performance.

## Data Model [PowerBI Desktop]
The provided data is in a single table format. The exploration revealed that it contains both categorical (dimensions) and numeric (facts) data.

We build a data model where dimensions and facts are separated, then they are linked together by logical relationship to form a star schema. The resultant data model is shown below...
